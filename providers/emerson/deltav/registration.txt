If you purchased Foundation Service at the time of system purchase, 
registration is still necessary to initiate the service. Foundation Service 
is a complete product support program that provides help desk consultation, 
remote diagnosis, software upgrades, access to on-line services, on-site 
service referral with priority response, and optional 24-hour emergency support. 
More information about Foundation Service and alternative service levels is 
included in the license pack.
